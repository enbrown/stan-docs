# Higher-Order Functions

Stan provides a few higher-order functions that act on other
functions.  In all cases, the function arguments to the higher-order
functions are defined as functions within the Stan language and passed
by name to the higher-order functions.

## Algebraic Equation Solver {#functions-algebraic-solver}

Stan provides a built-in algebraic equation solver. Although it looks
like other function applications, the algebraic solver is special in
two ways.

First, the algebraic solver is a higher-order function, i.e. it takes
another function as one of its arguments. The only other functions in
Stan which share this feature are the ordinary differential equation
solvers (see section [Ordinary Differential Equation Solvers](#functions-ode-solver)).
Ordinary Stan functions do not allow functions as arguments.

Second, some of the arguments of the algebraic solvers are restricted
to data only expressions. These expressions must not contain variables
other than those declared in the data or transformed data blocks.
Ordinary Stan functions place no restriction on the origin of
variables in their argument expressions.

### Specifying an Algebraic Equation as a Function

An algebraic system is specified as an ordinary function in Stan
within the function block. The algebraic system function must have
this signature:

```
 vector algebra_system(vector y, vector theta,
                              real[] x_r, int[] x_i)
```

The algebraic system function should return the value of the algebraic
function which goes to 0, when we plug in the solution to the
algebraic system.

The argument of this function are:

*   *`y`*, the unknowns we wish to solve for

*   *`theta`*, parameter values used to evaluate the algebraic system

*   *`x_r`*, data values used to evaluate the algebraic system

*   *`x_i`*, integer data used to evaluate the algebraic system

The algebraic system function separates parameter values, *`theta`*,
from data values, *`x_r`*, for efficiency in computing the gradients
of the algebraic system.

### Call to the Algebraic Solver

<!-- vector; algebra_solver; (function algebra_system, vector y_guess, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries algebra\_solver }!{\tt (function algebra\_system, vector y\_guess, vector theta, real[] x\_r, int[] x\_i): vector}|hyperpage}

`vector` **`algebra_solver`**`(function algebra_system, vector y_guess, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i)`<br>\newline
Solves the algebraic system, given an initial guess, using the Powell
hybrid algorithm.

<!-- vector; algebra_solver; (function algebra_system, vector y_guess, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i, real rel_tol, real f_tol, int max_steps); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries algebra\_solver }!{\tt (function algebra\_system, vector y\_guess, vector theta, real[] x\_r, int[] x\_i, real rel\_tol, real f\_tol, int max\_steps): vector}|hyperpage}

`vector` **`algebra_solver`**`(function algebra_system, vector y_guess, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i, real rel_tol, real f_tol, int max_steps)`<br>\newline
Solves the algebraic system, given an initial guess, using the Powell
hybrid algorithm with additional control parameters for the solver.

#### Arguments to the Algebraic Solver

The arguments to the algebraic solver are as follows:

* *`algebra_system`*: function literal referring to a function
specifying the system of algebraic equations with signature
`(vector, vector, real[], int[]):vector`.   The arguments represent
(1) unknowns, (2) parameters, (3) real data, and   (4) integer data,
and the return value contains the value of the algebraic   function,
which goes to 0 when we plug in the solution to the algebraic system,

*   *`y_guess`*: initial guess for the solution, type `vector`,

*   *`theta`*: parameters only, type `vector`,

*   *`x_r`*: real data only, type `real[]`, and

*   *`x_i`*: integer data only, type `int[]`.

For more fine-grained control of the algebraic solver, these
parameters can also be provided:

*   *`rel_tol`*: relative tolerance for the algebraic solver, type
`real`, data only,

*   *`function_tol`*: function tolerance for the algebraic solver,
type `real`, data only,

*   *`max_num_steps`*: maximum number of steps to take in the
algebraic solver, type `int`, data only.

#### Return value

The return value for the algebraic solver is an object of type
`vector`, with values which, when plugged in as `y` make the algebraic
function go to 0.

#### Sizes and parallel arrays

Certain sizes have to be consistent. The initial guess, return value
of the solver, and return value of the algebraic function must all be
the same size.

The parameters, real data, and integer data will be passed from the
solver directly to the system function.

#### Algorithmic details

The algebraic solver uses the Powell hybrid method [@Powell:1970],
which in turn uses first-order derivatives. The Stan code builds on
the implementation of the hybrid solver in the unsupported module for
nonlinear optimization problems of the Eigen library [@Eigen:2013].
This solver is in turn based on the algorithm developed for the
package MINPACK-1 [@minpack:1980].

The Jacobian of the solution with respect to auxiliary parameters is
computed using the implicit function theorem. Intermediate Jacobians
(of the the algebraic function's output with respect to the unknowns y
and with respect to the auxiliary parameters theta) are computed using
Stan's automatic differentiation.

## Ordinary Differential Equation Solvers {#functions-ode-solver}

Stan provides built-in ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers.
Although they look like function applications, the ODE solvers are
special in two ways.

First, the first argument to each of the solvers is a function
specifying the ODE system as an argument, like PKBugs
[@LunnEtAl:1999]. Ordinary Stan functions do not allow functions as
arguments.

Second, some of the arguments to the ODE solvers are restricted to
data only expressions. These expressions must not contain variables
other than those declared in the data or transformed data blocks.
Ordinary Stan functions place no restriction on the origin of
variables in their argument expressions.

### Specifying an Ordinary Differential Equation as a Function

A system of ODEs is specified as an ordinary function in Stan within
the functions block. The ODE system function must have this function
signature:

```
 real[] ode(real time, real[] state, real[] theta,
            real[] x_r, int[] x_i)
```

The ODE system function should return the derivative of the state with
respect to time at the time provided. The length of the returned real
array must match the length of the state input into the function.

The arguments to this function are:

*   *`time`*, the time to evaluate the ODE system

*   *`state`*, the state of the ODE system at the time specified

*   *`theta`*, parameter values used to evaluate the ODE system

*   *`x_r`*, data values used to evaluate the ODE system

*   *`x_i`*, integer data values used to evaluate the ODE system.

The ODE system function separates parameter values, *`theta`*, from
data values, *`x_r`*, for efficiency in computing the gradients of the
ODE.

### Arguments to the ODE solvers

The arguments to the ODE solvers in both the stiff and non-stiff cases
are as follows.

*   *`ode`*: function literal referring to a function specifying   the
system of differential equations with signature described in [ode functions](#functions-ode-function):

```
 (real, real[], real[], data real[], data int[]):real[]
```

The arguments represent (1) time, (2) system state, (3) parameters,
(4) real data, and (5) integer data, and the return value contains the
derivatives with respect to time of the state,

*   *`initial_state`*: initial state, type `real[]`,

*   *`initial_time`*: initial time, type `int`  or `real`,

*   *`times`*: solution times, type `real[]`,

*   *`theta`*: parameters, type `real[]`,

*   `data`   *`x_r`*: real data, type `real[]`, data only, and

*   `data`   *`x_i`*: integer data, type `int[]`, data only.

For more fine-grained control of the ODE solvers, these parameters can
also be provided:

*   `data`   *`rel_tol`*: relative tolerance for the ODE  solver, type
`real`, data only,

*   `data`   *`abs_tol`*: absolute tolerance for the ODE  solver, type
`real`, data only, and

*   `data`   *`max_num_steps`*: maximum number of steps to take in the
ODE solver, type `int`, data only.

#### Return values

The return value for the ODE solvers is an array of type `real[,]`,
with values consisting of solutions at the specified times.

#### Sizes and parallel arrays

The sizes must match, and in particular, the following groups are of
the same size:

*   state variables passed into the system function,  derivatives
returned by the system function, initial state passed  into the
solver, and rows of the return value of the solver,

*   solution times and number of rows of the return value of the
solver,

*   parameters, real data and integer data passed to the solver will
be passed to the system function

## 1D Integrator {#functions-1d-integrator}

Stan provides a built-in mechanism to perform 1D integration of a function via quadrature methods.

It operates similarly to the [algebraic solver](#functions-algebraic-solver) and
the [ordinary differential equations solver](#functions-ode-solver) in that it allows as an argument a function.

Like both of those utilities, some of the arguments are limited
to data only expressions. These expressions must not contain variables
other than those declared in the data or transformed data blocks.

### Specifying an Integrand as a Function

Performing a 1D integration requires the integrand to be specified somehow.
This is done by defining a function in the Stan functions block with the special signature:

```
real integrand(real x, real xc, real[] theta,
                      real[] x_r, int[] x_i)
```

The function should return the value of the integrand evaluated at
the point x.

The argument of this function are:

* *`x`*, the independent variable being integrated over

* *`xc`*, a high precision version of the distance from x to the nearest endpoint in a definite integral (for more into see section [Precision Loss](#precision-loss)).

* *`theta`*, parameter values used to evaluate the integral

* *`x_r`*, data values used to evaluate the integral

* *`x_i`*, integer data used to evaluate the integral

Like algebraic solver and the differential equations solver, the 1D
integrator separates parameter values, `theta`, from data values, `x_r`.

### Call to the 1D Integrator

<!-- vector; integrate_1d; (function integrand, real a, real b, real[] theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries integrate\_1d }!{\tt (function integrand, real a, real b, real[] theta, real[] x\_r, int[] x\_i): vector}|hyperpage}

`vector` **`integrate_1d`** `(function integrand, real a, real b, real[] theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i)`<br>\newline
Integrates the integrand from a to b.


<!-- vector; integrate_1d; (function integrand, real a, real b, real[] theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i), real relative_tolerance); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries integrate\_1d }!{\tt (function integrand, real a, real b, real[] theta, real[] x\_r, int[] x\_i, real relative\_tolerance): vector}|hyperpage}

`vector` **`integrate\_1d`** `(function integrand, real a, real b, real[] theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i, real relative_tolerance)`<br>\newline
Integrates the integrand from a to b with the given relative tolerance.


#### Arguments to the 1D Integrator

The arguments to the 1D integrator are as follows:

* *`integrand`*: function literal referring to a function specifying the integrand with signature  `(real, real, real[], real[], int[]):real`
The arguments represent
    + (1) where integrand is evaluated,
    + (2) distance from evaluation point to integration limit for definite integrals,
    + (3) parameters,
    + (4) real data
    + (5) integer data, and the return value is the integrand evaluated at the given point,

* *`a`*: left limit of integration, may be negative infinity, type `real`,
* *`b`*: right limit of integration, may be positive infinity, type `real`,
* *`theta`*: parameters only, type `real[]`,
* *`x_r`*: real data only, type `real[]`,
* *`x_i`*: integer data only, type `int[]`.


A `relative_tolerance` argument can also be provided for more control over the algorithm:

  * *`relative_tolerance`*: relative tolerance for the 1d integrator, type `real`, data only.


#### Return value

The return value for the 1D integrator is a `real`, the value of the integral.

#### Zero-crossing integrals {#zero-crossing}

For numeric stability, integrals on the (possibly infinite) interval $(a, b)$ that cross zero are split into two integrals, one from $(a, 0)$ and one from $(0, b)$. Each integral is separately integrated to the given `relative_tolerance`.

#### Precision loss near limits of integration in definite integrals {#precision-loss}

When integrating certain definite integrals, there can be significant precision loss in evaluating the integrand near the endpoints. This has to do with the breakdown in precision of double precision floating point values when adding or subtracting a small number from a number much larger than it in magnitude (for instance, `1.0 - x`). `xc` (as passed to the integrand) is a high-precision version of the distance between `x` and the definite integral endpoints and can be used to address this issue. More information (and an example where this is useful) is given in the User's Guide. For zero crossing integrals, `xc` will be a high precision version of the distance to the endpoints of the two smaller integrals. For any integral with an endpoint at negative infinity or positive infinity, `xc` is set to `NaN`.

#### Algorithmic details

Internally the 1D integrator uses the double-exponential methods in the Boost 1D quadrature library. Boost in turn makes use of quadrature methods developed in [@Takahasi:1974], [@Mori:1978], [@Bailey:2005], and [@Tanaka:2009].

The gradients of the integral are computed in accordance with the Leibniz integral rule. Gradients of the integrand are computed internally with Stan's automatic differentiation.


## Higher-Order Map {#functions-map}

Stan provides a higher-order map function.  This allows map-reduce
functionality to be coded in Stan as described in the user's guide.

### Specifying the Mapped Function

The function being mapped must have a signature identical to that of
the function `f` in the following declaration.

```
 vector f(vector phi, vector theta,
          data real[] x_r, data int[] x_i);
```

The map function returns the sequence of results for the particular
shard being evaluated.  The arguments to the mapped function are:

*   *`phi`*, the sequence of parameters shared across shards

*   *`theta`*, the sequence of parameters specific to this shard

*   *`x_r`*, sequence of real-valued data

*   *`x_i`*, sequence of integer data

All input for the mapped function must be packed into these sequences
and all output from the mapped function must be packed into a single
vector.  The vector of output from each mapped function is
concatenated into the final result.

### Rectangular Map

The rectangular map function operates on rectangular (not ragged) data
structures, with parallel data structures for job-specific parameters,
job-specific real data, and job-specific integer data.

<!-- vector; map_rect; (F f, vector phi, vector[] theta, data real[,] x_r, data int[,] x_i); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries map\_rect }!{\tt (F f, vector phi, vector[] theta, data real[,] x\_r, data int[,] x\_i): vector}|hyperpage}

`vector` **`map_rect`**`(F f, vector phi, vector[] theta, data real[,] x_r, data int[,] x_i)`<br>\newline
Return the concatenation of the results of applying the function f, of
type `(vector, vector, real[], int[]):vector` elementwise, i.e.,
`f(phi, theta[n], x_r[n], x_i[n])` for each `n` in `1:N`, where `N` is
the size of the parallel arrays of job-specific/local parameters
`theta`, real data `x_r`, and integer data `x_r`. The shared/global
parameters `phi` are passed to each invocation of `f`.
